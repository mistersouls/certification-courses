## Azure AD

External resources: Microsoft Office 365, Azure Portal, SaaS applications
Internal resources: Applications whithin your internal networking, Access to workstations on-premise

Azure AD to implement Single-SIgn on (SSO)

It comes in four editions
1. **Free** MFA, SSO, Basic security and usage reports, user management
2. **Office 365 Apps** company branding, SLA, Two Sync between On-Premise and Cloud
3. **Premium 1** Hybrid architecture, advanced group access, conditional access
4. **Premium 2** Identity protection, identity governance

### Azure AD - Use case

Authorize and authenticate to multiple sources:
* To your on-premise AD
* To your Web-application
* Allow users to login with their IpD eg. Facebook or Google
* To office 365 or Azure Microsoft

Azure AD connect => on-pemise

### Active directory vs Azure AD

Azure AD = Ad + an identity as a service IDaaS solution for all theirs apps across cloud and on-premises.


### Terminology

**Domain**: logical grouping of AD objects on a network

**Domain Controller (DC)**: a server that authenticates user identtities and authorize their access to resources

**Domain Computer**: a computer that is registered with a central authentication database. It would be an AD object.

**AD object**: the basic element of AD such as users, groups, printers, computers, shared folders...

**Group Policy Object (GPO)**: a virtual collection of policy settings. it controls what AD objects have access to.

**Organization Units (OU)** a subdivision within an AD into which you can place users, groups, computers and others OU.

**Directory service (AD DS)** provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and admin.

### Azure AD - Tenant

A tenat represents an organization
A tenant is a dedicated Azure AD Service instance.
A tenant is automatically created when you sign up for either
* Microsoft Azure
* Microsft Intune
* Microsft 365

Each Azure AD tenant is distinct and separate from Azure AD tenants

### Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

When doing a lift-and-shift from on-premise to Microsoft Azure and migrating Active directory, Azure AD soes not support some domain services.

AD DS provides managed domain service such as:
* Domain joins
* Group policies
* LDAP
* Kerberos / NTLM authentication

### Azure AD Connect

A hybrid service to connect your on-premise to your Azure account. It allows for seamless SSO from your on-premise workstation to Azure.

Azure AD connect has the following features:
* Password hash synchronization
* Pass-through authentication
* Federation integration
* Synchronization
* Health monitoring

### Azure AD - Users

* You can asign roles and **administrative roles** to users
* You can add users to groups
* Yiu can enforce authentication methods such as MFA
* You can track users sign ins
* Track devices user's login from and allow or deny devices.
* Assign microsoft licences

Two type of users:
* users
* Guest users

*Users are permanently deleted automatically 30 days after they are deleted.* You can restore before at.


### Azure AD - Groups

Groups lets the resource owner (or Azure AD directory owner), assign a set of access permissions to all the members of the
group, instead of having to provide the rights one-by-one.

**Groups contain**:
* Owners - Has permissions to add or remove members
* Members - Have permissions to do things

**Assignment**
* You can assign roles directly to a group
* You can assign applications directly to a group

**Request to join groups**
The group owner can let users find their own groups to join, instead of assigning them.


### Azure AD - Assign access rights

* **Direct assignment**: resource owner directly assigns the user to the resource.
* **Group assignment**: resource owner assigns an Azure AD group to the resource, which gives all of the group members access to the resource.
* **Rule-based assignment** resource owner creates a group and uses a rule to define which users are assigned to a specific resource.
* **External authority assignment**: Access comes from an external source, such as an on-premises directory or a SaaS app.

### Azure AD - External identities

Allow peeople outside your organization to access your apps and resources, while letting them sign in using whatever identity
they prefer.


### Azure AD - Device management

**What is Device identity manageemnt?**
The management of **physical devices** such as phones, tablets, laptops and desktops computers, that are granted access
to company resources such as Printers, CLoud resources vi *device-based Conditional Access*.

For companies with a distributed workforce, that allows remote remployess and employes who are allowed you use their own
personal equipment eg. **Brin Your Own Device (BYOD)**

A company needs a way to protect their organization's assets such as access to cloud resources across these devices
where they have *less control over the physical securities of the work environment*

### Types of Azure roles

Roles can be confusing because Azure has three types of roles that can serve same purpose 

1. Classic subscription administrator roles
This is the original role system

2. Aure roles
This is an authorization system is known as Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) and is built on top of Azure Resource Manager.

3. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles
Azure AD roles are used to manage Azure AD resources in a directory.


#### IAM Access controls

Allows you to create and assign roles to users.


**Azure Roles (RBAC system)** Roles restrict access to resource actions (also known as operations). There are two types of
roles:
1. Builtin Role
2. Custom Role

#### Classic administrators

It is the original role system. There is three types of roles:
1. Account administrator: The billing owner of the subscription. Has no access to the Azure portal
2. Service administrator: same access of a user assigned the owner role at subscription scope. Full access to the Azure portal
3. Co-adminsitrator same access of a user who is assigned the owner role at the subscription scope

#### Azure Role-BAsed Access COntrol (RBAC)

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) helps you manage who access to Azure resources, what they can do with those
resources, and what areas have access to.

A **role assignment** is consists of these three elements: Security principal, role definition, scope.

**Security Principal** represents the identities requesting access to an Azure resource such as: User, Group, Service Principal (used by app, service...), Managed identity (AD).

**Scope** is the set of resources that access for the role assignment applies to.

**Role definition** is a collection of permissions. A role definition lists the operation that can be performed such as **read**, **write** and **delete**

Azure has **built-in roles** and you can define **custom roles**

**built-in roles**: Owner, Contributor, Reader, User Access Administrator

#### Azure AD Roles

Azure AD roles are used to manage Azure AD resources in a directory such as:
* create or edit users
* assign administrative roles to others
* reset user passwords
* manage user licenses
* manage domains

A few important Built-in Azure AD roles you should know:
* Global Adminsitrator: Full access to everything
* User administrator: full access to create and manage users
* Billing administrator: Make purchases, manage subscriptions and supports tickets.

#### Policies vs RBAC

Azure Policies: ensure compliance of resource => doesn't restrict actions
Azure ROles: used to control access to Azure resources

#### Azure AD Roles vs Azure ROles (RBAC)

Azure AD Roles resources being: users, groups,, billing, licensing, application registration, ....
Azure Roles resources being: virtual machines, databases, cloud storage, cloud networking, ...

### Azure Policies

Azure policy enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale policies do not restrict access, they only observe for compliance.

**Policy definition** is a JSON file used to describe business rules to control access to resources.
**Policy assignment** the scope of a policy can effect. Assigned to a user, a resource group or management group.
**Policy parameters** values you can pass into your Policy definition so your policy are more flexible for re-use.
**Initiative definition** is a collection of policy definition that you can assign. eg. A group of policies to enfore PCI-DSS compliance.

#### Anatomy of an Azure policy definition file

**display name** identifies the policy (128 character limit)
**Type**
* Bult-in - maintained by Microsoft
* Custom - created by you
* static - micorosft owned, a regulatory compliance
**description**
**metadata** optional key value information
**mode** determines which resource type are evaluated
* Resource Manager
- All - resource groups, subscriptions...
- Indexed - only resource types that support tags and location
* Resource provider
- Microsoft.ContainerService.Data (deprecated)
- Microsoft.Kubernetes.Data
**Parameters:**
- name
- type
- metadata
**Policy Rule** consists of *if* and *then*. 

### Azure Resource Manager


#### Resource providers

In order to use Azure resources you have to register Resource Providers. Many resource Providers are registered by default for you with your subscription. You can register Resource providers under your subscription.


#### Resource tags

A tag is a key and value pair that you can assign to azure resources.

#### Resource locks

As an admin, you may need to lock a subscription, resource group or resource to prevent other users from accidentally
deleting or modifying critical resources.

In the Azure Portal you can set the following lock levels.

**canNotDelete (Delete)**: authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
**ReadOnly** authorized users can read a resource but they can't delete or update the resource

#### Azure blueprints

Azure blueprints enable quick creation of governed subscriptions. Compose artifacts based on common or organization-based
patterns into re-usable blueprints. The service is designed to help with environment setup.

Blueprints are declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts such as:
* Role assignements
* Policy assignments
* ARM templates
* Resource groups

The Azure Blueprints service is backed by the globally distributed **Azure Cosmos DB**
Blueprint objects are replicated to multiple Azure regions.

**ARM Templates vs Azure Blueprints**:
Nearly everything that you want to include for deployment in Azure Blueprints can
be accomplished with an ARM template.
**ARM teplate** stored either locally or in source control, no active connection or relationship to the ARM template
**Azure Blueprints** relationship between the blueprint definition and the blueprint assignment, can also upgrade
several subscriptions at one that are governed by the same blueprint.

Azure Blueprints supports **improved tracking and auditing of deployments.**
